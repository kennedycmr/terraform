# Overview
A place where I can gather all my Terraform snippets.

Enclosed in this repository is a collection of Terraform related pieces of code that I have come across. I generally will try and put into module form for re-usability, but not always. Ensure you refer to the comments and README files in each of the directories if they exist for context. 

Any code you find will be opinionated based on what I like to do and how I like to do it. But for the best information on the actual Terraform functions, refer to the Terraform knowledgebase at their website.
